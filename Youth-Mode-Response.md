In the case of K-HOLE #4, work that contained a strong political context that was clothed in ironic ambiguity was misresperesented by the mainstream media. Rather than fully understanding the differenciation between "Normcore" and "acting basic" many media outlets conflated the two terms. As a result, K-HOLE's report actually led to generic mainstream clothing becoming popular. 
The effect of K-HOLE's report describes what I see as the folly of the artist community. Rather than explain things in simple terms, K-HOLE follows the artistic trends of the 1990s and 2000s in incorporating a corporate persona into their artwork, as well as the further corporatization of web artists around 2009. The layers of irony leave room for misunderstanding and lack of clarity, resulting in a misinterpretation of the intended message.
The phrase "context is king", based of Bill Gates' often-quoted phrase "content is king" itself draws attention to the fact that in K-HOLE #4 speciically, a lack on effective context led to a misunderstanding of the goal of the artwork. Such misunderstandings may be intentional, but they  limit the potential audience for the art. Rather than display information in a straightforward way, K-HOLE provides a veiled message that is next to impossible to understand. It is no wonder that their ideas were not conveyed properly in mainstream media.
